# üß† Foundations of Computing: Set Theory, Logic Circuits & Assembly Encryption

This repository showcases a foundational computing project developed at Northumbria University. It explores the mathematical and hardware-level principles that underpin modern computation ‚Äî from abstract set operations to digital logic design and low-level encryption using Assembly Language.

## üìÅ Project Structure

- `SetTheory/`  
  Implementations of set operations, relations, and functions. Includes visualizations and performance analysis to demonstrate how set theory informs data organization and algorithm design.

- `LogicCircuit/`  
  Digital logic circuit simulations using truth tables, logic gate diagrams, and Boolean algebra. Highlights how logical reasoning translates into hardware-level decision-making.

- `AssemblyEncryption/`  
  A simple encryption system written in Assembly Language, demonstrating bitwise operations, control flow, and memory manipulation. Emphasizes how low-level programming enforces security and efficiency.

## üéØ Learning Objectives

- Understand how mathematical foundations like set theory support algorithmic thinking.
- Translate logical expressions into digital circuits using gates and truth tables.
- Apply Assembly Language to implement basic encryption and explore hardware constraints.
- Connect abstract theory with practical implementation across multiple computing layers.

## üõ† Technologies Used

- Mathematics (for set theory and visualization)
- Logisim / Digital circuit simulation tools
- x86 Assembly (MASM / NASM syntax) - WASP Simulator
- Markdown for documentation

## üìö Academic Context

This project was completed as part of the Level 4 Computing curriculum at Northumbria University. It reflects core learning outcomes in discrete mathematics, computer architecture, and low-level programming.

## üìà Visualization & Performance

Where applicable, runtime analysis and visualizations are included to highlight algorithmic efficiency and design trade-offs ‚Äî especially in the `SetTheory` folder.
